# nigeriadata
An open source R package for Nigeria Spatial and Non-spatial data

As part of my committment to open data, we have decided to create this package so that all R Users will have access to data
about Nigeria demography and settlements. It include both the spatial and Non spatial data...

To get started Run:

```install.packages("Devtool"')``` <br>
```install_github("Godskid89/nigeriadata")```

It is still a work in progress!
